Introduction
------------

The Open Chemistry project is a collection of open source, cross platform
libraries and applications for the exploration, analysis and generation of
chemical data. The project builds upon various efforts by collaborators and
innovators in open chemistry such as the Blue Obelisk, Quixote and the
associated projects. We aim to improve the state of the art, and facilitate the
open exchange of ideas and exchange of chemical data leveraging the best
technologies ranging from quantum chemistry codes, molecular dynamics,
informatics and visualization.

This repository contains git submodules for the Open Chemistry projects:
Avogadro, MoleQueue and MongoChem. It can be used to download all relevant
source files as well as building many of the necessary dependencies. Please
see the documentation in the submodules for more details about each project.

![Kitware, Inc.][KitwareLogo]

MongoChem is being developed as part of the [Open Chemistry][OpenChemistry]
project at [Kitware][Kitware], along with companion tools and libraries to
support the work.

Installing
----------

We provide nightly binaries built by our [dashboards][Dashboard] for Mac OS
X and Windows. If you would like to build from source we recommend that you
follow our [building Open Chemistry][Build] guide that will take care of
building most dependencies.

Contributing
------------

Our project uses Gerrit for code review, and CDash@Home to test proposed
patches before they are merged. Please check our [development][Development]
guide for more details on developing and contributing to the project. The
[project pages][Projects] provide bug, feature and support trackers, along
with many other features such as source browsing.

Our [wiki][Wiki] is used to document features, flesh out designs and host other
documentation. We have several [mailing lists][MailingLists] to coordinate
development and to provide support.
